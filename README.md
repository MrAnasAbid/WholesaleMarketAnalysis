# Sales Analysis Dashboard Project

## Objectives
In this project, our key objectives were to:

1. Determine the product line generating the highest revenue.
2. Identify the top-selling countries.
3. Assess the industry's profitability.
4. Examine the impact of customer status on revenue.

## Data Variables
To achieve our objectives, we created two new variables:
- **Profit**: Calculated as the difference between the total retail price for an order and the cost price per unit multiplied by the quantity ordered.
- **Cost Price**: Calculated as the cost price per unit multiplied by the quantity ordered.

## Key Findings
Our analysis revealed the following insights:

1. **Product Line Analysis**:
   - The "Sports" product line stands out with the highest profits and revenue, indicating strong customer interest.
   - The "Children" category, while selling well in terms of quantity, generates relatively lower revenue.

2. **Country Analysis**:
   - The United States leads in terms of quantity sold, followed by Great Britain.

3. **Profitability**:
   - Profit consistently exceeds costs, although there are some instances where they are close. 
   - Seasonal demand fluctuations are observed, especially in the summertime, correlating with higher sales in the "Sports" product line.

4. **Customer Status Impact**:
   - Platinum clients, despite their limited numbers, do not generate significantly higher average revenue compared to Gold and Silver clients.
   - Interestingly, Platinum clients occasionally incur costs higher than revenue, indicating that the "Platinum" status may serve other purposes, such as brand image.

## Conclusion
Our sales analysis dashboard provides valuable insights into product line performance, regional sales, profitability, and the role of customer status. These findings can inform strategic decisions and marketing efforts.
